# Google Play Store Data Analysis
This project performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Google Play Store app data using Python.  
The goal is to understand app trends based on ratings, reviews, installs, and categories through data cleaning and visualization.
***

## 📌 About the Project

The dataset contains information about various Google Play Store applications, including:
- App name
- Category
- Rating
- Reviews
- Number of installs

During analysis, invalid values, missing data, and outliers are handled to ensure accurate visualizations and insights.

## ✨ Project Features

- Data cleaning (handling missing values and invalid ratings)
- Distribution analysis of app ratings
- Category-wise total installs analysis
- Scatter plot visualization of Ratings vs Reviews
- Scaling large numerical values for better readability
- Use of color mapping to enhance scatter plots
